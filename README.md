A better version from my previous project called [COVID19_express](https://github.com/deepzS2/COVID19_express)

and the same README:
Covid-19 data is a website with all the information about the pandemic disease COVID-19 where it takes those data from the API on this file:

- [api.js](src/services/api.js)
- [API Documentation](https://corona.lmao.ninja)

if u want to upgrade this website, translate or whatever, just git clone it! Thank you and goodbye
